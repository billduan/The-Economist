# The-Economist
The Economist magazine weekly pdf [download](https://github.com/lry127/The-Economist/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

# Why this repository?
I'm looking for the pdf version of weekly *The Economist* magazine over the Internet, but found very few sites providing free download of the original edition. Worse, the download sites have annoying ads and download limits. So I create this repository and upload processed pdf for thoses who need it.

# Where do I get these pdf?
From:
- [magazinelib](https://magazinelib.com/?s=the+economist)
- [magazinebis](https://magazinebis.com/?s=The+Economist)

# How to help?
Download the newspaper from the websites mentioned above or somewhere else you know and make a PR.
Prefer an Asia Edition.

# What's the AD FREE edition?
The newspaper contains a few pages of advertisement, which results in an unhappy reading experience. So I decided to remove these unwelcomed pages. Every ad-removed pdf begins with the prefix 'AD FREE'.
