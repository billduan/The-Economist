~~The Economist magazine weekly pdf [download](https://github.com/lry127/The-Economist/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).~~


# Why this repository?
I'm looking for the pdf version of *The Economist* magazine over the Internet, but found very only few sites providing a free download. Worse, these sites have annoying ads and download limits. So I created this repository in hopes of helping those who need it.

# Where do I get these files?
From:
- [vk.com](https://vk.com/theeconomist_news)
- [magazinelib](https://magazinelib.com/?s=the+economist)
- [magazinebis](https://magazinebis.com/?s=The+Economist)

# How to help?
Download the newspaper from the websites mentioned above or somewhere else you know and make a PR.

# What's the AD FREE edition?
The newspaper contains a few pages of advertisement, which results in an unhappy reading experience. So I decided to remove these unwelcomed pages. Every ad-removed pdf begins with the prefix 'AD FREE'.
